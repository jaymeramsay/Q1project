## Technologies

* Javascript
* HTML
* Node
* HTML5 Canvas
* **[Konva.js](https://konvajs.github.io)** - Canvas library
* **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** - styling agent

## Challenges

* Teaching myself Konva and Bootstrap. So much time was taken to learn and integrate these libraries, but I learned that research is essential for any project.

* Finding the right image API. I could only find image APIs that stored images, not provided images for use. Instead, I drew all of the images myself.

* Refactoring the logic for resizing so it was more dynamic. This was a great experience in learning high-order and single responsibility functions. There were many details to keep track of!
